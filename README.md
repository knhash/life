## Customization

### Color Scheme

The application uses a pine green color palette defined by CSS custom properties in `css/styles.css`:

```css
--color-bg: #f4f9f4;        /* Light pine green background */
--color-bg-fade: #f4f9f4ee; /* Background with transparency */
--color-text: #2d4a2d;      /* Dark pine green text */
--color-life: #6b8e6b;      /* Medium pine green for life dots */
--color-future: #c8dac8;    /* Light pine green for future weeks */
--color-link: rgb(34, 102, 68); /* Deep pine green for links */
```

To customize colors, simply modify these variables at the top of the CSS file.

### Adding Life Events

Edit the `data.yml` file in the root directory. Events are grouped by the week they fall in:

```yaml
- 2025-07-15:
    name: 'Your new event'
    desc: |
      Description with **markdown** support.
      
      This event will appear in Week 29, 2025.
      
      ![Image](assets/your-image.jpg)
```

**Note**: Events that fall within the same week (Monday-Sunday) will be grouped together and display the same week number.
```

### Modifying Styles

Edit `css/styles.css` to customize:
- **Colors**: Modify CSS custom properties for theme changes
- **Typography**: Font families, sizes, and spacing
- **Layout**: Grid, spacing, and responsive breakpoints
- **Animations**: Heart animation and transitions
- **Background**: Clean solid color (background images removed for minimalist design)

### Adding Images

1. Add image files to the `assets/` directory
2. Reference them in event descriptions: `![Alt text](assets/filename.jpg)`

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support:
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Intersection Observer API

## Development

No build process required! Simply:
1. Edit files directly
2. Refresh browser to see changes
3. Deploy by copying files to any web server
